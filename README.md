# Seenema
### Project Overview
Seenema is a movie/tv show browsing website that allows users to browse movies, add movies to watchlist, and send movie recommendations to friends. 

### Layout of Repository
In this repository we have a folder for reports which contain all of our weekly status reports. We also have a file that takes care of the CI of our project. All the other files are the code to our project.
