- Subsection 1:

-     Division of duties confirmed
-     Flow chart of app functionality (Rough Draft) completed

- This week the team did well to work together and communicate as we begin the project. Although we did not meet in person, our virtual meeting to complete the Requirement Doc assignment was effective and collaborative. It seems that every member of the team is able to speak up when they have a concern, and all concerns are taken seriously. Danno was late to sign on to the github due to some access issues on his end, but those seem to all be resolved at this point. At this time there aren't any major concerns that anyone on the team has expressed, but I think all of us are feeling anxiety about getting a strong start on the project and making some tangible progress. I think we are looking forward to the project meeting (Thursday with Sahil) to help us get a clear direction for how we can move forward and make progress.

-     Determine the basic architecture of the Seenema project
