## Team report (status update for your TA, including an agenda for the project meeting)
- We think we are working from behind due to some communication issues in the first few weeks. We now meet 5 days a week 
and will continue to do so until we are on schedule or ahead. We've asked Sahil to join us one day (30 minutes) in
addition to the meeting we have during class on Thursday. We got the CI working on Wednesday. We had an issue because we
created some empty test files ahead of time. Once that was resolved things seem to be working now. We created two Jest tests


### Agenda for Project Meeting
1. Determine time for Sahil to join team meeting
2. Gather feedback or adjustments needed from last 3 assignments (Req., Arch., CI/CD)
3. Agree with Sahil on the process we need to highlight for feature demo 

### Subsection 1:
This week we finished and re-submitted both the Requirements Doc with the suggested edits as well as the Architecture Doc. 
We also asked Gail for an extension on the CI/CD assignment since we devoted time to the other documents. The CI is up and 
working thanks to Anand, and all the other requirements for the assignment have been completed. Now that we have completed 
these documents we are working hard to implement features that we can showcase for the next assignment. Leena has done a great 
job managing and maintaining our github repo as we work to get into the project. She's also working on the authentication aspect
of things. So we can ensure users are bale to login in seamlessly. Dishant has begun to work on the Homepage since we'll need 
that for our next checkpoint. Danno is beginning to work on the detail screen for each movie and will also begin to work on the 
ability for friends to add movies to another friend's watch list. Those won't be features we detail in the feature review.

### Subsection 2:
**Update (progress and issues):** 
Now that the repo and CI are set up and working, we are excited to begin committing code and seeing the project take shape. 

- **What we did:**
  - Finished all outstanding documenation and set up CI
  - Agreed on new meeting cadence to get ourselves back on track
  - Reached out to Sahil to get more guidance and support until we are stabilized

- **Insights:**
  - We had a hard time getting back up to speed after the Requirement Doc feedback, but we are
now accomplishing more each day. 
  - The CI set up was harder than anticipated. We had inserted some blank files for tests we already planned on creating, but 
doing so caused issues that we were not expecting. It took longer than anticipated to resolve those issues.

### Subsection 3:

#### Back end goals for the upcoming week:
- API integration and successful test with AWS Cognito (Leena)
- Sign up for TMDb and share out API key

#### Front end goals for the upcoming week:
- 100% completion of Version 1.0 of the Main Page (Dishant)
- 100% completion of Version 1.0 of the Detail Page of a single movie (Danno)
- 100% completion of Version 1.0 of the Search Bar to search for that single movie (Anand)

**Contributions of individual team members:**

##### Long Term Focus/Goal:
- Continuation of the communication that we are building within the team. We struggled a little at the beginning
but are doing better now. We are also focused on working to get back to a point where we are not finishing 
checkpoints/milestones on the day they are due. We want to get ahead.
